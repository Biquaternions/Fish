## Building and setting up

#### Initial setup
First, <u>clone</u> this repository. Do not download it.

Then run the following command in the root directory:

```
./gradlew applyAllPatches
```

The project is now ready for use in your IDE.

#### Creating a patch

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Compiling

Use the command `./gradlew build` to build the API and server. Compiled JARs
will be placed under `fish-api/build/libs` and `fish-server/build/libs`.
**These JARs are not used to start a server.**

To compile a server-ready paperclip jar, run `./gradlew createMojmapBundlerJar`.
To install the `fish-api` and `fish` dependencies to your local Maven repo, run `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`. The compiled paperclip jar will be in `fish-server/build/libs`.
